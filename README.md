Research Methodology Project

This repository contains the materials and code for the Research Methodology assignment. The project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes Multinomial and Naive Bayes Gaussian methods. Introduction

In this project, we aim to apply sentiment analysis techniques using Naive Bayes Multinomial and Naive Bayes Gaussian classifiers. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The goal is to classify sentiments accurately and present the findings in a structured format.
